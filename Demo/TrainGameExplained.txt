There are 2 sections of the game: movement between stations and at the station.

Currently, while the train is moving it will automatically add coal to the engine to produce steam.
Keep on the lookout for resources (just coal in this prototype) along the way.
Click on them to pick them up!

At the station you can buy and sell train cars and resources, rearrange the train, and pickup new jobs.
To edit the train you'll have to select 2 train cars and then hit the swap button to swap their positions.
In future train cars could get certain bonuses from being next to train cars of a particular type.
For example dining cars might provide a quality bonus to a passenger car.
For now, the last car is more vulnerable since if you run out of fuel you may have to sacrifice it.
Running out of fuel and sacrficing cars that have passengers/livestock/freight will lower your reputation.
Higher reputation means more available jobs and cars to buy.
